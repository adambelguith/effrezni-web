Preventing the destruction of products can help generate more bountiful yields. AI algorithms can compare images with historical data to detect whether a product is fresh or rotten.

However, with the development of the agricultural field and the explosive growth of rotten fruit detection machines and their high prices, it is difficult for the limited rotten fruit detection technology to reach the required level.

The purpose of the project is to develop a web platform (Named: Efrezni), where a consumer can choose a classifier model to classify fruits and vegetables or use the detection mode to detect rotten products.
